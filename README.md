# U-NetBioMedSegmentation

The initial stage in quantitatively analyzing microscopy images for biological and biomedical purposes frequently involves the segmentation of cell nuclei. 

Here we solve this problem using Neural Networks in Keras with a tensorflow backend. Specifically, we use a U-Net as invented and explained here; [https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597)
