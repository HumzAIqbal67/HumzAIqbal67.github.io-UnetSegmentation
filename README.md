# U-NetBioMedSegmentation

The initial stage in quantitatively analyzing microscopy images for biological and biomedical purposes frequently involves the segmentation of cell nuclei. 

Here we solve this problem using Neural Networks in Keras. Specifically, we use a U-Net as invented and explained here;

"There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks."

This project is still in the works.
